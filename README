This is a plug-in that will eventually allow you to use all of Google's api's in CakePhp.

so far i have only been working on the charts api as it is something that i needed but in time i will do others. I have created the files for what i plan to do so you can get an idea from that where this project is going.

look at the wiki for more information on how to use the helpers and behaviours you will find in this plug-in

they will all be self containing so that you are able to use them independent form each other.

As far as possible the api's will be complete alowing you to do anything that you could normaly do with the api, while making it far easier to use and understand as the helpers and behaviours will be doing all the hard work for you.

Everything is planed to use cache where possible to make your site as fast as possible. just have a look at the caching already implemented in the chart helper. also cuts out alot of network traffic. 

for a list of known issues have a look at the issue tracker. if you find something feel free to report it and ill have a look at it. or if you would like to help contribute feel free to make a branch and start.
